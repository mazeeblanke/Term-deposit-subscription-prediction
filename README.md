# Term Deposit Sale 

### Goal: 
Using the data collected from existing customers, build a model that will help the marketing team identify potential customers who are relatively more likely to subscribe term deposit and thus increase their hit ratio.

### <u>Domain:</u>
Banking

### <u>Context:</u>
This case is about a bank (TheraBank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its  liability  customers  to  personal  loan  customers  (while  retaining  them  as  depositors).  A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over  9% success.  This  has  encouraged  the  retail  marketing  department  to  devise  campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget.
